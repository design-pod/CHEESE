# CHEESE
This project is dedicated to sharing CHEESE, an acronym crafted by Michelle Riemann, Rodrigo Bassi Guerreiro, Ali Stocks, and Dagan Trnka in an effort to instill a safety mindset in freshman engineering students.

Cheese is accompanied by a 5 step process for moving through a tool operation:
1. Check your CHEESE
2. Check your tool
3. Check your piece and work path
4. Get checked off or request supervision if need be. Make it happen. 
5. Leave the space better than you found it. Leave no trace.
