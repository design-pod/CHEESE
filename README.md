# CHEESE
This project is dedicated to sharing CHEESE, an acronym crafted by Duke engineering students, Michelle Riemann and Rodrigo Bassi Guerreiro along with the Foundry Manager, Ali Stocks and the Design POD manager, Dagan Trnka. We made this in an effort to instill a safety mindset in freshman engineering students.

CHEESE is accompanied by a 5 step process for moving through a tool operation:
1. Check your CHEESE. Make sure you're good to go.
2. Check your tool. Make sure it's good to go.
3. Secure your workpiece and check your work path. Make it ready.
4. Get checked off or request supervision if need be. Make it happen. 
5. Leave the space better than you found it. Make it clean.


We're always looking for ways to make safety more accessible so if you have feedback/ideas for how we can do that, jump into the discussions section of this repository!
